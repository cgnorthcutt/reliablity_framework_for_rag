       "7    Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",

       "7   Letters of recommendation typically qualify as student records. In order to send a letter from a teacher at one school to the registrar at another, you might expect that schools would need signed consent from parents (if students are under 18) or students themselves (if 18 or older) to comply with FERPA. But under section 34 CFR § 99.31 of the Act, there’s an exception for this sort of record sharing. During potential transfers, educational institutions don’t need consent to send letters of recommendation to the destination school. This exception, however, doesn’t apply to sharing letters of recommendation outside of the educational system. “If [a school official] were sending a letter of recommendation to a potential employer, that official would need consent,” Rooker says. “There’s not an exception that lets [school staff] provide information from the student’s record to a potential employer.”   \n",
