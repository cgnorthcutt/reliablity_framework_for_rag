Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Mr LeCun said that he was offered the role of head of research at Google in early 2002. He stated that there were several reasons behind turning down the job offer, including the size of the company and the compensation package. The salary was low, especially at a time when he needed money to support his teenage sons, he said.\n",

        "As Mark Zuckerberg staffs up Meta’s new superintelligence lab, he’s offered top tier research talent pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in total compensation for the first year, WIRED has learned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meta has made at least 10 staggeringly high offers to OpenAI staffers, sources say. One high ranking researcher was pitched on the role of chief scientist but turned it down, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the negotiations. While the pay package includes equity, in the first year the stock vests immediately, sources say.\n",
        "\n",
        "“That’s about how much it would take for me to go work at Meta,” says one OpenAI staffer who spoke with WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the company. Other employees said that they were weighing the money against the potential impact they could have at Meta in comparison to OpenAI. Several believed their impact would be greater at OpenAI.\n",
        "\n",
        "“These statements are untrue - the size and structure of these compensation packages have been misrepresented all over the place,” says Meta spokesperson Andy Stone. “Some people have chosen to greatly exaggerate what’s happening for their own purposes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A senior engineer who spoke to WIRED confirmed their pay was around $850,000 per year at Meta—an impressive sum that pales in comparison to the packages currently on offer.

        "Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer at Meta, said that not everyone is getting a $100 million offer during a Q&A with employees last week. “Look, you guys, the market's hot. It's not that hot. Okay? So it's just a lie,” he said. “We have a small number of leadership roles that we're hiring for, and those people do command a premium.” He added that the $100 million is not a sign-on bonus, but “all these different things” and noted OpenAI is countering the offers.\n",

        "As a point of comparison, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, received $79.1 million in total compensation in 2024, most of it in stock, according to a financial filing by the company. Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber, made roughly $39.4 million (again, mostly in stock) the same year.\n",

        "On Monday, Mark Zuckerberg sent a note to Meta staff introducing the new superintelligence team. Alexandr Wang, formerly the CEO of Scale AI, is now Meta’s chief AI officer, Zuckerberg said. He’s joined by Nat Friedman who previously led GitHub. Together, Wang and Friedman will colead an organization Zuckerberg dubbed the Meta Superintelligence Labs. The company did not name a chief scientist or a chief research officer as part of the announcement. Neither Wang nor Friedman are thought of as researchers, at least in the traditional sense. None of the OpenAI staffers who left for Meta received the $300 million offer, according to a source with knowledge of the contracts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zuckerberg told potential recruits they would not have to worry about running out of resources, according to the Wall Street Journal. That’s an attractive offer in the AI industry, where access to cutting-edge chips, or GPUs, is highly competitive, and can influence how impactful the research ends up being. At OpenAI, researchers have complained that Altman has been known to promise people access to GPUs, only to feel like there was no follow through from leadership.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zuckerberg has successfully hired at least seven staffers from OpenAI for the effort—prompting Mark Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer, to send a note to staff over the weekend saying it felt “as if someone has broken into our home and stolen something.” Chen added that while OpenAI is recalibrating its own compensation packages for top talent, it won’t do so at the sacrifice of fairness. Chen also said that “a lot more supercomputers are coming online later this year.”\n",

Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Mr LeCun said that he was offered the role of head of research at Google in early 2002. He stated that there were several reasons behind turning down the job offer, including the size of the company and the compensation package.

        "In his post, the Meta AI scientist also revealed that at the time, Google had 600 employees and no revenue. \"You can't really do real research at that stage.

        "\n",
        "SAN FRANCISCO — One of the poorest-kept secrets in Silicon Valley has been the huge salaries and bonuses that experts in artificial intelligence can command. Now, a little-noticed tax filing by a research lab called OpenAI has made some of those eye-popping figures public.\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI paid its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, more than $1.9 million in 2016. It paid another leading researcher, Ian Goodfellow, more than $800,000 — even though he was not hired until March of that year. Both were recruited from Google.\n",
        "\n",
        "A third big name in the field, the roboticist Pieter Abbeel, made $425,000, though he did not join until June 2016, after taking a leave from his job as a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Those figures all include signing bonuses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The figures listed on the tax forms, which OpenAI is required to release publicly because it is a nonprofit, provide new insight into what organizations around the world are paying for A.I. talent. But there is a caveat: The compensation at OpenAI may be underselling what these researchers can make, since as a nonprofit it can’t offer stock options.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salaries for top A.I. researchers have skyrocketed because there are not many people who understand the technology and thousands of companies want to work with it. Element AI, an independent lab in Canada, estimates that 22,000 people worldwide have the skills needed to do serious A.I. research — about double from a year ago.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There is a mountain of demand and a trickle of supply,” said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and founder of Skymind, a start-up working on A.I.\n",
        "\n",
        "That raises significant issues for universities and governments. They also need A.I. expertise, both to teach the next generation of researchers and to put these technologies into practice in everything from the military to drug discovery. But they could never match the salaries being paid in the private sector.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2015, Elon Musk, the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, and other well-known figures in the tech industry created OpenAI and moved it into offices just north of Silicon Valley in San Francisco. They recruited several researchers with experience at Google and Facebook, two of the companies leading an industrywide push into artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to salaries and signing bonuses, the internet giants typically compensate employees with sizable stock options — something that OpenAI does not do. But it has a recruiting message that appeals to idealists: It will share much of its work with the outside world, and it will consciously avoid creating technology that could be a danger to people.\n",
        "\n",
        "“I turned down offers for multiple times the dollar amount I accepted at OpenAI,” Mr. Sutskever said. “Others did the same.” He said he expected salaries at OpenAI to increase as the organization pursued its “mission of ensuring powerful A.I. benefits all of humanity.”\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI spent about $11 million in its first year, with more than $7 million going to salaries and other employee benefits. It employed 52 people in 2016.\n",

Top names can receive compensation packages that extend into the millions.\n",

        "At DeepMind, a London A.I. lab now owned by Google, costs for 400 employees totaled $138 million in 2016, according to the company’s annual financial filings in Britain. That translates to $345,000 per employee, including researchers and other staff.\n",
